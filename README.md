# selector-savior

## Synopsis

A library that can be used to search a directory of files looking for files that contain
an element that matches a CSS selector.

Similar to [element-finder](https://github.com/keeganstreet/element-finder), but intended
to be used as a library or an application, instead of just as a CLI app. Additionally, I
have in mind some enhancements that will make it faster to search a very large set of files
(for instance a mirror of a larger website).
